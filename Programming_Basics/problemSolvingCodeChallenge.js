//Coding challenge: problem solving


//We need to identify in a written paragraph the 3 different perspectives found in the article. One way to do this is to:

/*
//1.
//scan the paragraph for identifiers that relate to the individual perspective

//2.
//design a function. scanForPerspective.
//create variables to define each perspective. The identifiers like he, she, we, I, you, etc.
//Scan every character to look for spaces
between every space make a variable (word)
Scan every variable to see if it matches a variable to set  to a perspective.
If the var(word) matches a var(perspective) it will return that perspective.

//3.
//Translating your ideas/thoughts to other people and then trying to connect the pieces.
