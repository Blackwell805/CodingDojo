// Code Challenge: Arrays - Nested
// Joe drives a taco truck in the booming town of Squaresburg. He uses an array of [x,y] coordinates corresponding to locations of his customers. He also uses an array of [x,y] as coordinates corresponding to location where he parks his truck. Customers walk from their location to his truck, but he wants to minimize the total distance from truck to customers, so is looking for a better place to park. 
//Feature request: given a customer coordinate array, return an optimal taco truck location.

// Here's what we know: City blocks are perfect squares, and every street is two-way, at perfect right angles. He only parks by street corners (coordinates like [37,-16]). Customers only travel on streets: coordinate [2,-2] is distance 4 from [0,0]. Joe checks the array before deciding where to park. Given a customer coordinate array, return an optimal taco truck location.
